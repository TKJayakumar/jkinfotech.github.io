1. **Main Menu**: Upon execution, the program presents a menu with three options: College Information, Admission, and Fees Structure.

2. **College Information**: Provides information about JK University, including its ranking, placements, and details about different departments such as Engineering, Medical, Arts and Science, and Management. Users can select a department to view more details about its admission process and cutoff marks.

3. **Admission**: Allows prospective students to apply for admission to different courses offered by JK University. Depending on the selected course (Engineering, Medical, Arts and Science, or Management), the program collects relevant information such as the student's name, email, mobile number, and subject marks. It then determines the eligibility criteria based on cutoff marks and allows the student to apply if eligible.

4. **Fees Structure**: Displays the fee structure for different courses offered by the university, including Engineering, Medical, Arts and Science, and Management. Users can select a course to view its corresponding fees.

5. **Summary**: The program seems well-structured, with clear sections for each functionality and appropriate prompts for user input. It utilizes file handling to store information about student admissions in a file named "jkinfo.doc." Additionally, it includes error handling for invalid inputs and provides options to return to the main menu or exit the program.
